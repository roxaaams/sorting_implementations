# sorting_implementations

Homework 1 from Algorihms and Data Structures II: 

You are to write a C++ program that will implement InsertionSort and HeapSort. The sorting algorithm should be identifcal in both cases: you find the largest element, you take it out of the set and put it on the last position. The difference is that the two objects the algorithm interacts with are different: 

1. A IS class, that is more or less a vector object, for insertionsort. 

2/ A HS class, that is essentially a max=heap, for heapsort.
